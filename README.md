# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for macOS. Manages `~/.config/nvim`, `~/.config/wezterm`, and Hack Nerd Font.

## Requirements

Neovim 0.12+, plus a few CLI tools the config shells out to. Install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install neovim wezterm tree-sitter-cli ripgrep fd asdf
```

- `neovim` — editor.
- `wezterm` — terminal.
- `tree-sitter-cli` — required by `nvim-treesitter` (main branch) to build parsers. The plain `tree-sitter` formula is the library only.
- `ripgrep`, `fd` — used by Telescope for find/grep.
- `asdf` — manages Ruby and Node runtimes; Mason needs both to install LSP servers.

### asdf: set user-level defaults

Mason installs LSP servers via `gem` (Ruby) and `npm` (Node). If asdf has no active version, installs fail. Set user defaults once:

```sh
asdf install ruby 3.4.6
asdf install nodejs 22.17.0
asdf set -u ruby 3.4.6
asdf set -u nodejs 22.17.0
```

## Install

Sync this repo into `~/.config` and install fonts:

```sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` rsyncs each `.config/<name>` into `~/.config/<name>` and copies fonts into `~/Library/Fonts` (macOS) or `~/.local/share/fonts` (Linux).

## First-time Neovim setup

On first launch, lazy.nvim bootstraps itself and pulls plugins. After that:

1. `:Lazy sync` — install/update all plugins.
2. `:TSUpdate` — build Treesitter parsers.
3. `:Mason` — verify LSP servers installed (`lua_ls`, `ruby_lsp`, `stimulus_ls`, `herb_ls`, `tailwindcss`). Check `:MasonLog` if anything fails.

## Pulling local changes back into the repo

`import.sh` does the reverse of `install.sh` — pulls configs from `~/.config` back into the repo for anything already tracked here.

```sh
./import.sh
```
